# --- WALKER RULES ---
# 1. Float it (so it doesn't tile)
windowrulev2 = float, class:^(walker)$

# 2. No animations (Walker has its own animations, double animation looks weird)
windowrulev2 = noanim, class:^(walker)$

# 3. FORCE FOCUS (The fix for your typing issue)
windowrulev2 = stayfocused, class:^(walker)$
